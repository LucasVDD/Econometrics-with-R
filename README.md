# Econometrics with R
Welcome to Econometrics with R!

I really enjoy programming in R as it's both robust and flexible for most statistical analysis. 

I first started using R in my second year of university in Econ 2500 - Introductory Statistics for Economists I. Since then I haven't practiced much, but this is a way for me to start again.

**Huge credits to Econometrics Academy by Prof. Ani Katchova from OSU.**

After I've completed all of the Masters and PHD Econometrics Academy models I will be transfering it to a separate folder and working on my own projects.
